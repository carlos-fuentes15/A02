Git is a software that tracks the changes that happened to the files in someone's computer. You can search up the software on your browser and download the service.
Once you have downloaded Git, you must complete its setup process. It is up you if you would like to read all the information regarding the service. Then it will allow you to activate or deactivate some of the features the service provides. It is up to the user to deceide if they would like certain features to be activated to satisify their needs. Once the user finishes picking out the features they want, they can start using Git. Git essentially allows you to manage and keep track of any coding that you make. Github is a service that allows you to manage any repository that you make in Git, making it easier for the user to manage the source code. Webstorm is an IDE, which allows you to code HTML, javascript, style sheets and many more. All you have to do is simply search up Webstorm on your browser and download the service. This file, https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows, will directly send you to the website in order to download the service. Once you download, it will let you customize the IDE.
